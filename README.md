# Advanced SQL Querying

These SQL Select statements are structured to filter results from a database 
based on spcific conditions. The database used in these statements is 
Oracle 12c / SQL Developer. The data in the database is a combination of 
bowlers and their information. For example, the bowler's first and last names, 
tournaments they played in with scores, different tournaments, etc.
The comments above each statement provide information on what is going to be queried.
There is a text file in this repo named advanced_querying_OUTPUT.txt. This file
includes the output from each query.

NOTE: There are two .sql files in this repo you need to run before running th
      queries. The first .sql file is BowlingLeagueStructure.sql. After running
      that file, run the BowlingLeagueData.sql file.Doing this in order will ensure
      you set up the database and have the structure and data entered correctly.
NOTE: The data being used is fictional and is for practice only.
